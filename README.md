# LeetCode Solutions in Java

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to various **LeetCode** challenges and problems, written in **Java**. The solutions cover a wide range of topics, including data structures, algorithms, dynamic programming, and more. I aim to solve problems daily as part of the LeetCode challenge to improve my problem-solving skills.

## Structure
- Each problem is organized in its respective folder, which includes:
  - The problem statement (as comments or a README in the folder).
  - Java code file (`.java`) containing the solution and necessary explanations.
  
## Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching
- Bit Manipulation
- Math
- Greedy Algorithms
- And more...

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-solutions-java.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the problem folder you are interested in.
3. Open the `.java` file to see the solution to the problem.

## LeetCode Daily Challenge
- I aim to solve at least one LeetCode problem every day as part of the daily challenge to stay consistent in my coding practice.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Java**: All solutions are implemented in Java.
- **LeetCode**: Problems and challenges come from the LeetCode platform.
